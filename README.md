# MathProcedures
Various tests of functionability and logic
This program has several functions across different classes. The sections include:
  -- The NumberWizard game where the console attempts to guess a random number of user's choosing
        -- The cosnsole asks the user to choose a number between 1 and 1000.
        -- The console then guesses random numbers and the user responds to the console saying whether their number is lower and higher or             equal to the number the console guessed.
  -- A section on string manipulation
        -- The user will enter a string to be manioulated
        -- That string will be returned in two different formats:  1. Odd letters and even letters are grouped together and seperated by a                                                                          '+' then displayed in the console.
                                                                   2. Consonants, vowels, and puncuation marks are seperated into groups                                                                            and then displayed in a similar style to the odds/evens string                                                                            above.
  -- A grocerylist section
        -- The user is prompted to enter the name of the item, the unit which it is quantified by, and then quantity.
        -- They are able to add as many items as they wish to the list and when they are finished the entire list will be printed to the              console.
        -- The user is also able to erase the entire list and start over if they make any mistakes.
  -- A fibonacci section
        -- The fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers where the current value is the sum of the two previous values in the sequence.
                EX: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 ) 0 + 1 = 1, 1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, etc.
        -- The user determines what position within the sequence the program will execute to.
        -- The program returns the value that is located at the user's desired position.
